# DevOps Training - Day 1: Introduction to DevOps

## Overview

The first day of the DevOps class focused on laying the foundation of DevOps practices and culture. We began with an introduction to DevOps, discussing how it bridges the gap between development and operations teams. The topics were explained using slides

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. What is DevOps?

**DevOps as a Culture and Practice:**  
DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal is to shorten the development lifecycle, increase deployment frequency, and improve the quality of software through enhanced collaboration and automation.

**DevOps vs Waterfall vs Agile:**

| Model      | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Waterfall** | A traditional, linear, and sequential model. Each phase must be completed before the next begins. |
| **Agile**     | An iterative and flexible approach. Encourages frequent feedback and is ideal for dynamic, evolving projects. |
| **DevOps**    | Builds upon Agile by integrating operations with development. Enables Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). |

### 2. DevOps Lifecycle

The DevOps lifecycle includes several stages that repeat in a continuous loop. These are:

- **Plan:** Define business requirements and features.
- **Code:** Develop the application using version-controlled repositories.
- **Build:** Compile the code and prepare it for testing.
- **Test:** Perform automated and manual testing to ensure quality.
- **Release:** Package and version the application for deployment.
- **Deploy:** Push the application to production or staging environments.
- **Operate:** Manage the application in the live environment.
- **Monitor:** Continuously observe system performance, logs, and user feedback for improvements.

### 3. DevOps Practices

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**  
  Developers frequently commit code to a shared repository. Automated builds and tests ensure that integration issues are identified early.

- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):**  
  Once the code passes all testing phases, it is automatically pushed to production (CD) or made ready for manual deployment (Continuous Delivery).

- **Continuous Monitoring:**  
  Real-time monitoring of applications and infrastructure to detect and resolve issues quickly. Enables proactive responses to incidents.

### 4. Tools in the DevOps Pipeline

Different stages of the DevOps lifecycle use specific tools to enable automation and efficiency:

| Stage         | Tool(s) Used                      |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Planning**  | Jira – For project tracking and management |
| **Source Control** | Git – Distributed version control system |
| **CI/CD**     | Jenkins, GitHub Actions – For automating build, test, and deployment processes |
| **Monitoring**| Prometheus, Grafana – For collecting and visualizing real-time metrics |

### 5. Collaboration Among Stakeholders

**Who are the stakeholders in DevOps?**

- **Developers:** Write code, implement features, fix bugs.
- **Testers:** Ensure the software meets quality standards through functional and non-functional testing.
- **Operations Team:** Handle deployment, infrastructure, and maintenance of live environments.
- **Clients and Business Teams:** Define requirements, track performance, and provide feedback for improvements.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

- Each team member is responsible not only for their individual tasks but also for the overall success of the software product.
- DevOps encourages **shared ownership**, where teams work together across silos.
- Communication and collaboration are crucial for effective DevOps adoption.
